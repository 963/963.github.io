I actually published [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BypDzkL_ZHyMWWRWSm50QzZNRTQ/view?pli=1) nearly 10 month ago.

The document  especially shared at **deep web** and deep web forums then i saw this tweet again last night.

I decided to write this topic as my first blog post. İ will write more detailed about **Tor** and **OpenWrt** later. İ am sharing introduction and content part from document below.


----------

introduction
------------

**Anonabox**, the plug-in Internet router that claims it makes your online activity anonymous. The project has raised about nearly $600,000, after **Kickstarter** suspended the controversial project. If you don't remember this project, [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XxcLTwR8Kw) can help you.

We can do same job or more using some hardware with [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/).

If you use wireless repeater to install **OpenWrt**, you will have a **Tor hardware** with same features like **Anonabox**. It will look like Anonabox.

I will use **Nexx WT3020H** for this job but you can prefer other hardwares. If you want to test same device, you can buy one from [here](http://tr.aliexpress.com/item/WT3020H-Portable-Mini-USB-Flash-Drive-Wifi-Wireless-Roteador-Repeater-With-Firewall-Free-Shipping/2042796430.html?recommendVersion=1). It surprisingly looks exactly like Anonabox as you can see.

WT3020H is actually just a **wireless repeater** but we can modify it for our needs. If you modified this device as below you can use it like wireless repeater again.
